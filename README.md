## Project Description

This project was developed by graduate students in Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program in collaboration with KPMG US. The purpose was to develop models that forecast the earnings growth in the overall S&P 500 Index as well as the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Information Technology, Telecommunications, and Healthcare sectors. Models were constructed using traditional economic indicators as well as predicted recession and monetary policy features.

## Code Description

## 01. Data Cleaning

## 02. Recession Prediction
The recession prediction model helps capture turning points in the business cycles and send near-term recession siganls; therefore, the results of the recession model is incorporated as an engineered feature into the overall market short-term model to improve overall model accuracy. Specifically, this recession model takes the difference between 10-year and 3-month Treasury rates (also defined as the “yield spread”), as well as other economic indicators to calculate recession probability in 12-month ahead horizon.

#### Input data: The independent variables including adjusted yield spread and several economic indicators are used to predict 12-month ahead NBER recession dates. 

<ins>Independent Variables</ins>  

* Yield Spread/Inversion of the Yield Curve =  10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate - 3-month treasury bill - secondary market rate (Quandl)
* Adjusted Yield Spread - equation reference: [Robobank Reference](https://research.rabobank.com/publicationservice/download/publication/token/8Wsu7NXGcHfF4ZkWAkjg)
* Unemployment Rate (Quandl) 
* Fed Funds Rate (Quandl) 
* CPI (Quandl)

<ins>Dependent Variables (DV) </ins> : NBER recession dates (Quandl): 
* NBERt,t+12, equals one if there is an NBER recession starting at any time in the 12 months that follow the observed independent variables, and zero otherwise. 

#### Output data:

#### Process:

1. Load both independent and dependent variable data from quandl (note: quandl API key needed) 
2. Fill recession dates: replace NA values by zeros & visualize recession data 
3. Transform raw data: 
   * Unemployment Rate: log differential
   * CPI: log differential
   * Fed Funds Rate: differential
   * Adjusted Term Spread using equation from Robobank
4. Manipulate recession dates (DV) to prepare for 12-month prediction horizon
5. Select three machine learning models: Guassian, SVM, Random Forest Classifier
   * Set training set ["1962-01-31":"2006-01-31"] and testing set ["2006-01-31" and onwards]
   * Calculate model accuracy: AUC score, True & False Positive rates 
   * Choice the best performing model (SVM) based on model performance metrics
6. Predict recession probability using *model.predict_proba*
7. Visualize model performance
   


## 03. Fed Funds Rate Prediction

Folder links to separate repo. Refer to README in fed_funds_rate folder for more information.

## 04. Short Term Overall Model

For the short term, we're using a **Facebook Prophet Model**. After trying a few methods to improve the model, the final model is an **additive model with both endogenous trend decomposition and exogenous regressors**. 

**We've adopted a Rolling Window Cross Validation approach**, where we'll be predicting from the cutoff point to cutoff+horizon. The time before cutoff point, length of which is the intial/lookback period, is the training set. The training set and prediction results rolls along the entire dataframe.

##### Input data:
* data_short_term.csv (In which target variable is from the client and other data are previous processed data) **We used Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE) to identify the most important features from all the data we have which could be found in the data folder of this repository**
* COVID_Boolean.csv (We identify that Covid starts from March, 2020, therefore starting from March of 2020 the variable value equals 1, whereas previous values equal to 0.)
* preprocessed_recession_probability.csv (Preprocessed based on recession prediction results from **02. Recession Prediction**)
* preprocessed_Fed_minutes.csv (Preprocessed based on Fed minutes prediction results from **03. Fed Funds Rate Prediction**)

##### Output data:
* Prediction results of 1-12 month horizon from the Facebook Prophet Model (Path: KPMG_forecasting_model/script/Final Short-term Model/**X**_month_prediction.csv)

##### Process (short-term_model_with_new_variables.ipynb)
1. Load target variable and economic indicator independent variables (whose data processing procedure and data source could be found in the data and script folder)
2. Load data for recession probability prediction, fed funds rate prediction and the Covid Boolean
3. Use the **generate_model_result** function, which is the concentrate of our intermediate results and thoughts of model improvement; **The parameters are tuned such that seasonality is set as 'multiplicative', initial as 6 years, horizon as 1-12 months, and cutoff half of the horizons respectively)**
4. Apply the function with different horizons (1-12 month) and write csv files for each
5. As these files include duplicate rows, use the **updatedf** function to eliminate duplicate rows
6. Apply the function and the output would be the prediction results wanted
7. Plot the predictions and residules
